# Coefficient of restitution

The coefficient of restituition of a pair of ball-bounce surface is the ratio of the relative velocity of separation after collision to the 
relative velocity of approach before collision. We measured it for several combinations using two different methods:

- [Method1](/Coefficient_of_restituition/Method1) consists of measuring the **maximum height** after the first bounce of the ball. The latter is dropped at zero velocity from progressively greater heights. We videotaped each motion to measure the maximum height.
- [Method2](/Coefficient_of_restituition/Method2) is to measure the **time interval** between bounces using an app that recognizes the sound made by the bounce and triggers a stopwatch.

The [report](/Coefficient_of_restituition/coefficient_of_restitution_report.pdf) is open for consultation.
