# Elastic springs

Using data provided by the professors.
- For the [static method](/Spring/Capstone_data/Static), we graphed the distance of the spring from the ground as the hanging mass changes with [PASCO Capstone software](https://www.pasco.com/products/software/capstone) and interpolated the gra√®h with a straight line.
- Fort the [dynamic method](/Spring/Capstone_data/Dynamic) we compared the motion data of the spring when it is moved from its equilibrium position with the motion law expected: $M \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -kx + Mg$
 
In conclusion, Hook's law for [springs](/Spring) was verified and the elastic constant k was determined with both the static and dynamic method. The [report](/Spring/spring_report.pdf) is open for consultation such as the complete [data analysis](/Spring/spring_data_analysis.pdf).
