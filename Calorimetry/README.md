# Calorimetry measures

To execute the experiments the following instrumentation was needed:
- a calorimeter of Regnault's mixtures,
- a scale,
- a termometer,
- a DC power supply,
- a stopwatch.

At first we estimated the **equivalent mass in water** (the amount of water needed to absorb the same heat that is subtracted from the calorimeter and other objects in it).
Than we could:
- Determine the **specific heat of copper** by measuring the time gravities of water and copper before and after reaching thermal equilibrium.
- Verify the **Joule constant** by sampling temperature increases during successive time intervals of 120s.
- Measure the **latent heat of ice** knowing mass of water and ice immersed in the calorimeter and initial and equilibrium temperatures of the two substances.

The data and their [analysis](/Calorimetry/calorimetry_data_analysis.pdf) are open for consultation.
