## Lab I projects
Lab I is a laboratory course I took in my first year in BSs in Physics. Lab I is meant to help students become **familiar with data collection and analysis** procedures that require the application of formulas learned in **statistics class**. For every experiment we studied and estimated statistic and sistematic errors in order to obtain reliable and accurate results.  

Laboratory experiences allowed us to explore all the basic dynamic or thermodynamic phenomena:
- The [pendulum](/Simple_pendulum)'s period of oscilation is an indicator of the constant of acceleration g.
- Observing the phenomena of [Reversible pendulum (or Kater pendulum) oscillations and the free fall of a metal ball](/Reversible_pendulum_and_free_fall) are two more accurate methods to obtain an estimate of g.
- Hook's law for [springs](/Spring) was verified and the elastic constant k was determined with both the static and dynamic method.
- With an experiment on different [vibrating_string](/Vibrating_string) was tested the dependence of the frequency of a transverse wave passing over a string on the physical characteristics of the string.
- Through [Collisions](/Collisions) between two trolleys we experienced the differences between elastic and inelastic collisions.
- The [coefficient of restitution](/Coefficient_of_restitution) of differnt kinds of balls was determined by bouncing the balls on different types of floors in our homes.
- For [Calorimetry](/Calorimetry) measures we estimated the equivalent mass in water that is needed to absorb the same heat that is subtracted from the calorimeter and other objects in it, determined the specific heat of copper and verified the Joule constant and latent heat of ice
- In this experiment with the [electrostatic Coulomb's scale](/Electrostatic_Coulomb's_scale) we wanted to verify Coulomb's law and determine the dielectric constant in vacuum
