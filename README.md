## Lab I projects
Lab I is a laboratory course I took in my first year in BSs in Physics. Lab I is meant to help students become **familiar with data collection and analysis** procedures that require the application of formulas learned in **statistics class**. For every experiment we studied and estimated statistic and sistematic errors in order to obtain reliable and accurate results.  

Laboratory experiences allowed us to explore all the basic dynamic and thermodynamic phenomena, we have ascertained that:
- The [pendulum](/Simple_pendulum)'s period of oscilation is an indicator of the constant of acceleration g.
- Observing the phenomena of [Reversible pendulum (or Kater pendulum) oscillations and the free fall of a metal ball](/Reversible_pendulum_and_free_fall) are two more accurate methods to obtain an estimate of g.
- [Springs](/Spring) follow Hooke's law of elasticity.
- The motion of a [vibrating_string](/Vibrating_string) depends on the physical characteristics of the string and the tension to which it is subjected.
- Elastic and inelastic [collisions](/Collisions) between two trolleys conserve energy and momentum.
- The [coefficient of restitution](/Coefficient_of_restitution) varies with the pair ball - bounce surface.
- With a [Calorimeter](/Calorimetry) one can determine thermodynamic constants such as the specific heat of a material or the latent heat of ice, and verify the Joule constant.
- The [electrostatic Coulomb's scale](/Electrostatic_Coulomb's_scale) can be used to verify Coulomb's law and determine the dielectric constant in vacuum.
