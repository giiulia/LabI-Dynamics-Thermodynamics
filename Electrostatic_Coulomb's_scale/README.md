## Electrostatic Coulom's scale

This torsion balance makes it possible to study the electrostatic interaction between two charged spheres. For safety reasons this time the data were given by the professors, 
we stroed them in [data.py](/Electrostatic_Coulomb's_scale/data.py) and proceded with the analysis using the program [Coulomb's_scale_main.cpp](/Electrostatic_Coulomb's_scale/Coulomb's_scale_main.py).

With this experiment it was:
- demonstrated the **dependence of the Coulomb force** on the inverse of the square of the distance between the charges;
- measured the dielectric constant in vacuum;
- and measured the wire twist constant.

The [data analysis](/Electrostatic_Coulomb's_scale/Coulomb's_scale_data_analysis.pdf) with plots and conclusions is open for consultation.
