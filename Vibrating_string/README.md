# Vibrating string
Through an experiment on different [vibrating_strings](/Vibrating_string) the dependence of the frequency of a transverse wave passing over a string on the physical characteristics of the string was tested. In particular we measured:

- The frequence of oscillation of five harmonic waves with **increasing number of nodes**.
- The **velocity of propagation** of the wave knowing mass of the string, its lenghth and the tension force to which it is subjected.
- The root dependence of the frequence of oscillation of a particoluar harmonica at **different tension forces**.

The [report](/Vibrating_string/vibrating_string_report.pdf) is open for consultation such as the complete [data analysis](/Vibrating_string/vibrating_string_data_analysis.pdf).
