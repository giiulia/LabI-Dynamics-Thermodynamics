## Reversible pendulum (or Kater pendulum)
The purpose of this experiment was to calculate an **estimate of the acceleration
of gravity** by observing the relative periods of the two knives of the pendulum Kater's for **different configurations of the positions of the masses A and B**.

It can be shown that, observed a certain period T*, the relation holds:
$T^∗ = 2π\sqrt{\frac{D}{g}}$
where T* corresponds to the periods T1 (period of an oscillation with respect to knife 1) and T2 (relative to knife 2) in a configuration of the pendulum such that they are equivalent.
Therefore we measured T1 and T2 several times moving only one mass and found a configuration in wich they could be similar. In this configuartion we **mesured T and derived g**.

## Free fall
Thw equipement used for this experiment consisted of a tower few centimeters high with a built in sensor at the end that triggered a stopwatch. Unfortunately the stopwatch
was broken so we used the photocell used for Kater's pendulum experiment. This new configuration introduced systematic errors due to the difficulty of the execution therefore we got a sensibly **less precise estimte of g**.
