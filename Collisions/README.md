The equipment used for the experiments consists of a rail on which one or two
trolleys:

- Different types of buffers can be inserted on the front of the carriage: a pair of magnets, a spring, or a hook. On the other side are two pieces of Velcro
that allow the trolley to attach to another trolley and a snap plunger. This allows for elastic or inelastic (partially or totally) bumps. 
- The carts are equipped with **time, position, speed, force, and acceleration sensors**. The sensors communicate to the computer via Bluetooth. The acquisition software is managed by [Capstone](https://www.pasco.com/products/software/capstone). 

## Elastic collisions
We executed and analyzed the following elastic collisions:

- same weight trolleys
- one trolley weights 500g more than the other

## Inelastic collisions
We executed and analyzed the following inelastic collisions:

- same weight trolleys
- one trolley weights 500g more than the other

In addition we calculated the book-rail **friction coefficient** varying the book's mass.
