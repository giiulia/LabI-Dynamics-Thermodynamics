## Simple pendulum

For this expericence **we built a simple pendulum** with a string a a small metal ball. 

- For the first part of the experience we chronometrated the pendulum passings and determined the period of 10 oscillations various times. This allowed us to highlight the presence of **random errors** in our measures.
- The correlation between the pendulum's period of oscillation and lenght of the string allowed us to derive an estimate of the constant of **acceleration of gravity on earth** (g). This value's reliability was quantified.
- Next, we **quantified the effects of the approximations** made on the estimate of g.
