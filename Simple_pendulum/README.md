## Simple pendulum

For this expericence **we built a simple pendulum** with a string a a small metal ball. We chronometrated its passings and determined the period of 10 oscillations various times. 
The correlation between the pendulum's period of oscillation and lenght of the string allowed us to derive an estimate of the constant of **acceleration of gravity on earth** (g).
